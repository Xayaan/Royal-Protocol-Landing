<ReadMore text="Royal Protocol is a cutting-edge software development company which uses blockchain technology to reimagine how the mainstream gaming industry could be replaced by gaming ecosystems which empower and support users instead of profiting at their expense. The current industry has normalized the implementation of predatory practices and dark patterns so successfully that it's hard to picture games without them. But we at Royal Protocol believe it's time for a change. By modernizing the way digital gaming content is created, distributed, we introduce the Royal Protocol vision of an open world which empowers users and creators alike.
