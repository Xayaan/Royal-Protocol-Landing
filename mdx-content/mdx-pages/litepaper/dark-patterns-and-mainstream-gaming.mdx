These unethical methods are considered culturally-acceptable simply because there are no reliable, accessible alternatives. Gamers must approach these issues from a place of practiced resignation in order to still find enjoyment within a morally-grey system; a system which collapses on itself when public accountability becomes the norm. Users who are involved in online gaming frequently find themselves interacting with dark patterns, such as loot boxes, pay to skip, or artificial scarcity, which are intentionally designed to be money traps. Furthermore, mainstream gaming standards prevent transparency by not requiring games to honestly represent the odds within their software, or if those odds could fluctuate based on of skill/purchase history.
